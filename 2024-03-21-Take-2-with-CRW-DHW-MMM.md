I am revisiting this post from last year, where I was trying to download data from NOAA's CRW to calculate MMM and DHW for my reef sites. [Post 
here](https://github.com/ademerlis/ademerlis.github.io/blob/main/_posts/2023-12-04-DownloadingSSTCoralWatchData.md)

I found Dr. Ana Palacio's code on [her GitHub](https://github.com/anampc/DHW_Uva/tree/master) that documents really well her scripts for downloading the 
data from NOAA's database.
