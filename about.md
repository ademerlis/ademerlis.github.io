I am a marine biologist passionate about the resilience of reef-building corals in the face of anthropogenically induced climate change, mainly rising ocean temperatures. I had no coding experience prior to the start of my PhD, so this was all a huge steep learning curve for me. Especially learning transcriptomics, which is the study of gene expression patterns using bioinformatics. I mainly use R and sometimes the terminal (bash) for my code. This website right now serves as documentation for my progress on learning different programs and skills for analyzing RNA-seq data. It is by no means a tutorial, as most of the stuff probably didn't work! But I am finding that this format is super useful for keeping track of R code that I tried, so it is easier for me to start back up again even after a few days (or weeks) away from the project.
