I just wanted to put all these somewhere for when I need them. Stringtie is what Jill Ashey used following STAR alignment. In the past I used Subread (I think?) for Pdam. 

I think Natalia just downloaded the STAR results and used that: https://github.com/China2302/SCTLD_RRC/blob/main/06a_gene_expression_analysis.Rmd

Anyways here are the stringtie articles I found to look at later:
1. https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/
2. https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3122
3. https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie
4. https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1910-1
5. https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-022-08465-0 (review of transcriptome analysis methods with reference genome)
