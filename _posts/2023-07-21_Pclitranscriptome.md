Michael Studivan created a Google Drive of different species' transcriptomes, and the one for Pclivosa comes from [Avila-Magana et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25950-4). I'm not sure if Michael separated out everything from the metatranscriptome, but the file I have downloaded is called "Dip_Host.fna.gz". So it is just the coral host.

I used scp to transfer it onto Pegasus.
